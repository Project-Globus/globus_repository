* **Source:** The Source folder contains two subdirectories: "GlobusAndroidAppFiles" and "Server". 

"GlobusAndroidAppFiles" contains all of the code, through its multiple revisions, of the android application source code. Please read ANDROID_README.md for a walkthrough of those materials.

"Server" contains all of the server-side code, including the database interaction library, through its multiple revisions, of the code used by our server. Please read SERVER_README.md for a walkthrough of those materials.

* **Documents:** Here will be the documents you write to describe your project.  The
  boiler plate includes a use case template and a sample use case.  Both of these
  are taken from [Cockburn's use cases website][1], which contains many other useful tips
  on writing effective use cases (as does his book).  The use cases are written
  down in [Markdown][2] format.  You may convert them to your word processor of
  choice.  This folder also includes a sample specification document from a real
  software company.  That is a good example of what a requirements document for this
  class should look like.

* **Resources:** This folder contains Jim Ward's Android support library, which was used during the development of the android application.
